//! Model router: picks the cheapest model that still meets a task's declared
//! quality tier, before the request is priced and forwarded.
//!
//! FinOps cost optimization only. `proxy::messages` calls [`Router::route`]
//! between `parse_request` and `estimate_cost`: the decision is applied (or,
//! in shadow mode, just reported) before anything downstream prices,
//! reserves, or forwards the call. The router never touches budget,
//! reservation, breaker, or cache logic itself; it only decides which model
//! identity the rest of the pipeline sees.
//!
//! Contract (never routes up by default):
//! - Among a task class's candidates whose declared tier meets the class's
//!   `required_tier`, the router picks whichever is strictly cheaper than the
//!   requested model. If one exists, that is the new model.
//! - If none is cheaper, the requested model is kept, UNLESS the requested
//!   model's own declared tier (from anywhere else in the rules table) is
//!   known and falls below the class's `required_tier`. That is the one case
//!   where a rule explicitly requires a higher tier than what was asked for,
//!   and the router upgrades to the cheapest candidate that satisfies it,
//!   even though it costs more. A model the router has no tier opinion on is
//!   never upgraded, so cost can only go down for models outside the rules
//!   table.
