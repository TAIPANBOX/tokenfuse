//! Outcome-tag unit economics (P4 — "what does one resolved case cost").
//!
//! `crates/gateway/src/proxy.rs` captures an opaque `X-Fuse-Outcome` tag per
//! call, verbatim, into the trace (`sink::CallRecord::outcome`) — capture
//! only, no run-level state is built in the proxy (the hot path stays
//! untouched). This module is the read side: given the flat per-call rows
//! loaded from the Parquet trace, it answers "for each outcome tag, how many
//! runs, how much did they cost, how many calls did it take". Mirrors
//! [`crate::savings`] in shape: pure aggregation over a `Call` list, no I/O.
//!
//! ## Outcome semantics: last non-empty tag per run wins
//!
//! An agent typically tags only its FINAL call of a run (e.g. `case_resolved`
//! once the ticket is closed), but any call in the run may carry the header,
//! and a later call's tag should override an earlier one (an agent that
//! re-tags a run from `escalated` to `case_resolved` as the situation
//! resolves). So a run's outcome is defined as: the LAST non-empty `outcome`
//! value recorded for its `run_id`, in call order (`step` is the per-run
//! sequence counter the gateway assigns — see `sink::CallRecord::step` — so
//! it, not `ts_millis`, is the reliable per-run ordering key: multiple calls
//! of a fast local run can share a millisecond, but never a step). A run that
//! never sent the header at all is `(untagged)`.
//!
//! ## Why post-processing, not SQL
//!
//! [`compute_outcomes`] takes the "last non-empty per run" winner and the
//! per-outcome rollup as two passes of plain Rust over an already-loaded
//! `Vec<Call>`, rather than expressing "last non-null value per group" as a
//! DataFusion window query. A `LAST_VALUE(...) IGNORE NULLS OVER (PARTITION
//! BY run_id ORDER BY step)` query is expressible but adds a second,
//! harder-to-test SQL surface for logic that is a handful of lines of
//! straightforward Rust — and it would need its own reasoning about NULL vs.
//! `''` (the trace's actual "unset" sentinel, per the schema-evolution
//! COALESCE convention — see `sink::CallRecord`). Loading once and folding in
//! Rust keeps the winner-selection logic in one place, next to its tests,
//! consistent with how `compute_savings` favors a pure aggregation over a
//! wider SQL query.
