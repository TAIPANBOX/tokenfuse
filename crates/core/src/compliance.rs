//! Compliance control catalog: a machine-readable, deliberately HONEST mapping
//! from TokenFuse's runtime controls to external security/compliance
//! frameworks.
//!
//! The differentiator this catalog encodes is that TokenFuse's controls are
//! **enforced at runtime** — every block is a real decision on the wire
//! (`crate::breaker::BreakerReason::as_wire_str`), every MCP finding is a real
//! scanner output (`crate::mcpreport` / `crate::mcpexposure`), and every
//! anomaly is a real Cloud incident (`tokenfuse-cloud` `store.rs`). Competitors
//! that only *describe* controls in a spreadsheet cannot point at per-decision
//! wire evidence.
//!
//! Because over-claiming compliance is a legal liability, honesty is a
//! first-class, machine-readable field ([`Enforcement`]) rather than prose:
//!
//! - [`Enforcement::Enforced`] — the control blocks (or flags) at runtime and
//!   emits the cited evidence today.
//! - [`Enforcement::Partial`] — the mechanism exists but is off-by-default,
//!   operator-supplied, or awaiting a follow-up before it can be claimed
//!   against a framework control.
//! - [`Enforcement::Documented`] — described in the design docs but not yet
//!   wired to runtime evidence. No catalog entry currently uses this state: we
//!   prefer `Partial` whenever *any* enforcement is wired, and we simply omit
//!   controls we cannot honestly claim at all (see the gap notes below).
//!
//! # Framework identifiers
//!
//! External identifiers were looked up against the current published sources
//! (retrieval date pinned in [`FRAMEWORK_VERSIONS`]) so nothing is mis-cited —
//! mis-citing a standard is itself an over-claim. Where a MITRE ATLAS technique
//! id could be confirmed (`AML.T0051` LLM Prompt Injection) it is used
//! verbatim; where it could not be confirmed with confidence, the ATLAS
//! **tactic** is referenced by name (e.g. `"Exfiltration (tactic)"`) rather
//! than inventing an `AML.Txxxx` id. Newer Oct-2025 agent-focused ATLAS
//! techniques (`AML.T0086` Exfiltration via AI Agent Tool Invocation,
//! `AML.T0110` AI Agent Tool Poisoning) exist but are intentionally left as
//! tactic-level references here pending independent confirmation.
//!
//! # Gaps we do NOT claim (honesty, stated explicitly)
//!
//! - **Data residency / geo-fencing.** TokenFuse does not pin where provider
//!   traffic or telemetry is stored/processed. Not claimed against any control.
//! - **Model governance / bias / fairness.** TokenFuse is a runtime cost and
//!   agent-safety control point, not a model-evaluation or bias-testing
//!   product. EU AI Act Art. 10 (data governance) and bias obligations are
//!   **out of scope** and deliberately absent from the catalog.
//! - **Independent audit.** Per `docs/13-security-hardening.md`, this is an
//!   engineering hardening pass, not a third-party audit or penetration test,
//!   and enforcement is **fail-open** by design (a broken enforcer briefly
//!   stops enforcing rather than stopping all traffic). A green catalog is not
//!   a certification.
