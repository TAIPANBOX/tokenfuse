# 20 - The identity map: key <-> agent <-> unit binding, strict mode, unit budgets

Status: design + build plan for the `feat/identity-map` slice. Follows the
roadmap line in `PROGRESS.md` ("budgets above the run (per key / agent / team /
org)... the `key_id -> team` mapping and threshold alerts are the next
increment") and builds directly on PR #119 (client keys / `key_id`).

Defensive intent, as everywhere in TokenFuse: everything here exists so an
operator can attribute, constrain and stop THEIR OWN agents inside their own
perimeter. Nothing reaches outside the gateway the operator runs.

## 1. Problem

After #119 the gateway has three disconnected identity layers:

1. A real credential: `x-fuse-key` -> server-resolved `key_id` (who may call).
2. A free-form attribution header: `x-fuse-agent-id` (who claims to be
   calling) - deliberately unauthenticated, so unusable as a budget key.
3. Nothing at all for a business unit / team.

Nothing can currently say: "this credential may only speak as these agents,
those agents belong to unit `treasury`, and `treasury` has a $2,000 monthly
cap". This doc adds exactly that linking, declaratively, with no registry
service and no new dependencies.

## 2. Operator surface

Two new environment variables:

- `TOKENFUSE_IDENTITY_MAP=/path/identity.json` - the declarative map (below).
  Unset = everything off, exactly today's behavior. Set but unreadable or
  invalid = the gateway refuses to start (same fail-closed posture as
  `TOKENFUSE_CLIENT_KEYS`: a typo must never silently disable what the
  operator believes is on).
- `TOKENFUSE_IDENTITY_STRICT=off|warn|enforce` (default `off`) - governs ONLY
  the key<->agent binding check. Unit BUDGETS follow `TOKENFUSE_MODE`
  (shadow|warn|enforce) like every other budget: the money knob governs money,
  the identity knob governs identity.

The map is JSON (not YAML: zero new dependencies, and the stack's config
artifacts - passports, descriptors - are JSON already):

```json
{
  "units": [
    { "id": "treasury", "name": "Treasury", "owner": "user://bank.example/olena",
      "budget_usd_month": 2000.0 }
  ],
  "keys": [
    { "key_id": "treasury-bots", "unit": "treasury",
      "agents": ["agent://bank.example/treasury/*"] }
  ],
  "prefixes": [
    { "match": "agent://bank.example/treasury/*", "unit": "treasury" }
  ]
}
```

- `units[].budget_usd_month` is optional; a unit without it is
  attribution-only.
- `keys[].key_id` refers to a `TOKENFUSE_CLIENT_KEYS` key id. `keys[].agents`
  patterns bound which `x-fuse-agent-id` values that credential may present.
  An empty/missing `agents` list means "any agent id", binding the key to the
  unit for attribution without constraining the id.
- `prefixes` is the fallback for traffic with no (or no mapped) key: pure
  attribution, never a mismatch.
- Patterns are a literal string or a single trailing `*` (prefix match).
  Anything else is rejected at load - no glob engine, no new dependency.
- Every `unit` referenced by `keys`/`prefixes` must exist in `units`
  (load-time refusal: typos must not silently create unattributed spend).
- Unknown JSON fields are tolerated (the stack-wide additive convention).

## 3. Resolution and enforcement semantics

On every managed `/v1/messages` call, after `key_id` and `agent_id` are known:

1. If `key_id` is non-empty and has a `keys[]` binding: the binding's `unit`
   is the call's unit. If the binding lists `agents` patterns and `agent_id`
   does not match any (or is empty), that is a MISMATCH.
2. Otherwise: the first matching `prefixes[]` entry gives the unit; no
   mismatch is possible on this path (nothing is authenticated to check
   against).
3. No match anywhere: unit is empty. Spend stays visible under the implicit
   "unassigned" bucket in every aggregation (never silently dropped).

Mismatch handling by `TOKENFUSE_IDENTITY_STRICT`:

- `off`: resolution still runs (unit attribution on the trace), no check.
- `warn`: the call proceeds; the response carries
  `x-fuse-identity: would-block=<reason>`; the trace row keeps the resolved
  binding's unit.
- `enforce`: `403` with the stable error contract (below), a `CallRecord`
  with `decision: "identity_mismatch"`, and an `identity_mismatch`
  agent-event. The call never reaches the provider.

Unit budget handling (only when the resolved unit has `budget_usd_month`),
by `TOKENFUSE_MODE`:

- `shadow`/`warn`: unit spend is recorded (reserve-then-settle, unchecked),
  never blocks.
- `enforce`: the estimate is reserved against the unit's remaining monthly
  budget BEFORE the run-level reserve; exceeding it returns `402` with
  `type: "unit_budget_exceeded"`, a `CallRecord` with
  `decision: "unit_budget_exceeded"`, and a `breaker_tripped` agent-event
  whose `data` names the unit. If the unit reserve succeeds but the run-level
  reserve then fails, the unit reservation is released (settled at zero).

The month window is the UTC calendar month (FinOps/chargeback-friendly);
counters roll over on the first call of a new month.

### Honest limitations (stated, not buried)

- Unit counters are in-process and per-gateway: they reset on restart and are
  NOT fleet-consistent across multiple gateways. Run budgets can already be
  raft-replicated; unit budgets deliberately do NOT touch the replicated
  ledger in this slice (a new dimension in raft state is a schema-identity
  decision, per this repo's invariants). Fleet-consistent unit caps are a
  future slice; the durable cross-fleet VIEW of unit spend lives in the Cloud
  aggregation, which is fed by the trace and survives restarts. That view
  carries a month-to-date rollup mirroring this same UTC-calendar-month
  window (`/v1/units` `month_*` fields), with two stated approximations: the
  Cloud windows by its own receive clock (so a call in flight exactly at the
  month boundary can land one window off by the telemetry batching delay,
  seconds), and attribution is per call as resolved at call time, never
  re-attributed when a run's unit is named later. On a plane upgraded
  mid-month the counter starts at the upgrade (an under-count for that first
  partial month) - there is no per-month history in old snapshots to
  backfill from, and passing lifetime spend off as a month is exactly what
  this rollup exists to avoid.
- Budgets remain estimate-then-settle; the system stays fail-open on internal
  errors, as documented for run budgets.
- With client keys off, `strict` has nothing authenticated to check: binding
  checks idle (a startup log says so) and only prefix attribution applies.

## 4. Wire contract additions

- New Breaker reasons:
  - `unit_budget_exceeded` - HTTP 402, budget-family error body
    (`budget_usd`/`spent_usd` carry the UNIT's numbers).
  - `identity_mismatch` - HTTP 403, minimal error body (like
    `dlp_blocked`/`taint_blocked`: no budget fields).
  The five existing 402 bodies stay byte-identical (golden test).
- New response header in warn mode: `x-fuse-identity: would-block=<reason>`.
- Trace: `CallRecord` gains a `unit` column (empty when unresolved), following
  the nullable-evolution rule: nullable in the read schema so old Parquet
  files keep reading, non-nullable in the write schema going forward - the
  exact pattern `key_id` used in #119.
- Agent events: new `identity_mismatch` type (severity `high`, the
  DLP/taint family); `breaker_tripped` events gain `"unit"` in `data`.
- FOCUS export: a new `x_unit` column, one value per call row.
- Cloud API (additive only):
  - ingest accepts the new `unit` field on records (defaults to empty).
  - `GET /v1/units` - per-unit aggregation for the org (viewer role). Each
    row carries all-time totals plus `month`/`month_spent_microusd`/
    `month_calls`: the month-to-date mirror of the unitledger window
    (UTC calendar month, lazy rollover), sorted highest month-to-date
    first. See section 3's honest limitations for the boundary/attribution
    approximations; the dashboard compares the monthly caps against these
    month columns, falling back to an explicitly-labeled all-time figure
    on planes that predate them.
  - `POST /v1/units/{id}/budget` - central monthly-cap override (admin role,
    audited like run-budget changes).
  - `GET /v1/unit-budgets` - flat `{unit: microusd}` map for gateway pollers.
    A separate endpoint (not a new key inside `/v1/budgets`) because the
    existing budgets payload is a flat `run_id -> i64` map old gateways parse
    verbatim; changing its shape would break them.
- Gateway polls `/v1/unit-budgets` (same 3 s cadence and error posture as the
  run-budget poller) and applies overrides on top of the map file's caps.

## 5. Build slices (each independently green)

1. `identitymap.rs` - parse/validate/resolve + unit tests. No behavior wired.
2. `CallRecord.unit` threading - sink schema (read nullable / write
   non-nullable), sqlq mixed-schema coverage, focus-export `x_unit`,
   mechanical construction-site updates. Mirrors #119's `key_id` diff.
3. Enforcement wiring - `unitledger.rs` (UTC-month reserve/settle),
   breaker reasons, `identity_mismatch` event type, proxy gates
   (mismatch 403 / unit 402 / warn header), state + main config, startup
   logs, cross-check warning when a map `key_id` has no client key.
4. Cloud - ingest `unit`, `UnitAgg` + `/v1/units`, unit-budget store +
   `POST /v1/units/{id}/budget` + `/v1/unit-budgets`, audit entries, OpenAPI
   DTOs; gateway unit-budget poller.
5. Docs - README section, PROGRESS.md, this file kept current.

Out of scope for this PR (named follow-ups): dashboard grouping by unit;
fleet-consistent unit caps via the replicated ledger; mockryx drill scenarios
(`identity-mismatch`, `unit-budget`) which live in the mockryx repo;
threshold alerts per unit.

## 6. Decision log (Q1-Q6 from the D15 planning doc, resolved 2026-07-23)

- Q1 strict default: `off`; `warn` is the recommended first step in prod.
- Q2 unit budget window: UTC calendar month.
- Q3 passports directory convention: `~/.taipan/passports/` (consumed by
  onboarding tooling, not read by this slice).
- Q4 first-pilot IdP assumption: Entra ID (affects the console, not this
  slice).
- Q5 WebAuthn action scope (console): kill, break-glass, budget mutation,
  policy write, approval grant.
- Q6 open/paid split confirmed: this slice is open TokenFuse; onboarding
  wizard + IdP login + WebAuthn ceremonies belong to the paid console.
- Map format: JSON, not YAML (zero new dependencies; config artifacts across
  the stack are JSON).
